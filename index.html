    <p>Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.</p>

    <h1>"Rise in International Cricket" </h1> 
    <p>Virat Kohli made his ODI debut in August 2008 against Sri Lanka, showcasing early promise.
    He was part of the 2008 U-19 World Cup-winning team, which brought him into the spotlight.
    Kohli made his Test debut in 2011 against the West Indies and T20I debut in 2010 vs Zimbabwe.
    His first ODI century came in 2009 against Sri Lanka, marking the start of his consistency.
    The 2011 World Cup win solidified his position as a dependable middle-order batsman.
    Kohli’s 133 against Sri Lanka in 2012* during a chase became a defining knock.
    He was soon recognized as a chase master for his ability to win matches under pressure.
    In 2013, he smashed the fastest ODI century for India (at that time) against Australia.
    His aggressive style and confidence earned him vice-captaincy and eventually captaincy.
    By 2014, Kohli was considered the next big thing in world cricket, dominating all formats.</p>

    <h1>Fitness and Lifestyle</h1>
    <p>Virat Kohli is widely credited with revolutionizing the fitness culture in Indian cricket. Early in his career, he realized the need to improve his physical conditioning and underwent a dramatic transformation—shedding extra weight and adopting a highly disciplined lifestyle.

    Kohli follows a strict diet, largely plant-based, focusing on high-protein, low-fat meals, and avoids processed sugar and junk food. He often talks about the importance of hydration, balance, and mindful eating. His workout routine includes strength training, agility drills, cardio, and mobility work, making him one of the fittest cricketers in the world.

    His transformation didn’t just elevate his own game—it set a new benchmark for the Indian team. As captain, he emphasized fitness standards, introduced yo-yo tests, and built a team culture where athleticism and endurance became non-negotiable. This shift played a key role in India becoming a dominant force in Test cricket, especially in overseas conditions.

    Beyond cricket, Kohli’s dedication to fitness has inspired millions of fans to adopt healthier lifestyles. He often shares workout videos and tips, motivating young athletes to prioritize fitness as much as skill.</p>
